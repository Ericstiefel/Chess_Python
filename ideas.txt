- Temporal Difference instead of MCTS
Maybe instead of using fully explored lines with MCTS, use BFS with Temporal Difference and use a NN to evaluate the end position while being under a time constraint
Possibly just use this method in bullet, where it wont have time to explore full lines


- Time usage

Use a lightweight NN to quickly evaluate the time that should be spent on the next move (i.e. use more time in critical positions)
8x8 -> float
Min time spent something like a second
